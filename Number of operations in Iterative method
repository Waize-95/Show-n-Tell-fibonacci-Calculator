Number of Operations:
The number of operations in the above code are 4n+1. 
Base Case Check : (n==0 || n==1)
Total operations : 3 (two assignment, one logical)
Variable Initialization : (a=0 && b==1)
Total operations : 2 (one for x one for  y)
Loop : (i=1 and The loop runs n-1 times)
	Inside The Loops: ( 1 Addition, 2 Assignments)
Total operations : 4(n-1).

Total number of Operations : 3 + 2 + (4n-4) = 4n+1.
