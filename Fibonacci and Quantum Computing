4 Fibonacci and Quantum Computing
4.1 Fibonacci Anyons
In topological quantum computing, Fibonacci anyons are hypothetical particles
that follow non-Abelian statistics. These particles are so named because their
quantum states follow the Fibonacci sequence. When anyons are braided (moved
4
around one another), they change the quantum state of the system in a way
that depends on the order of the braiding, a property crucial for topological
quantum computing. The robustness of these quantum states against local
perturbations makes them ideal for creating stable qubits. Using Fibonacci
anyons in a topological quantum computer could pave the way for more resilient
and efficient quantum computations.
