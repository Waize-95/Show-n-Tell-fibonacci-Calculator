Q- How can I make this more interactive and visual to engage the audience?
Ans-
1. Visual Pattern Exploration with Color-Coding:
Preparation of a chart that shows the divisibility of the Fibonacci numbers.
2. Interactive �Mod� Activity
   Give each participant a small card with a Fibonacci number on it and have them apply modular arithmetic. 
   For example, they can divide their number by 3 and note the remainder (the �mod 3� result).
   Ask them to call out their mod results to reveal Pisano periods (the cycle lengths in mod). 
   You could demonstrate, for instance, that the sequence mod 3 will show a repeating pattern of 8 terms.
3. Digital Visualization with Calculators or an App
If a Fibonacci calculator or app is available, show how quickly it computes terms. 
You can use this to explore specific numbers that are divisible by chosen divisors
4. Real-World Connection
   To engage their curiosity, explain briefly how this modular repetition (Pisano periods) has applications,
   such as in cryptography. You could mention how cryptographic algorithms rely on these cycles for encoding
   information securely, adding a real-world relevance to the concept,
