DNA CRYPTOGRAPHY
Introduction to DNA Cryptography
We all know DNA already stores information about our body from eye color to skin tone. It programs our entire body. DNA is made up of four bases ADENINE, GUANINE, CYTOSINE, and THYMINE or AGCT. The specific groups of these three are known as codons.
Example
 In 1999 in NEW YORK scientists substituted all 64 possible codons with letters, numbers and grammar symbols. Then they arranged these codons in specific order to form a message which was then hidden on a letter under a smudge. This letter was then mailed back to them, upon receiving they took the DNA sample decoded and thatâ€™s how they received the message secretly. A beautiful example of cryptography.
It soon became obvious that DNA cryptography can code much more then text. By translating binary codes in DNA codons digital data can be programmed into synthetic data and then it can be translated back to 0 and 1.
Benefits 
Hypothetically it is considered that 400 followed by 6 zeros GB data can be stored on a fingertip. U can literally store all the movies in HD in a small tube literally the size of baby finger.
We all know that digital devices wore out after few decades resulting in the loss of information well DNA has a half-life of 500 years meaning half of its bonds will break after 500 years and if left in a dark cold place their half can increase up to 200,000 years.
