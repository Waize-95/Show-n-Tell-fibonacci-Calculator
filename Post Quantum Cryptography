POST QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHY
Post quantum cryptography is being developed as quantum computers will be able to break al classical cryptography methods mentioned above. Question here is will it be able really safe as it is the purpose.
Challenges
Can post quantum algorithms keep up with pace of quantum computers.
If quantum cryptography only becomes accessible to powerful governments how will it affect the data privacy system around the world.
