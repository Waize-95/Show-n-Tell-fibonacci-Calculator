Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and the Fibonacci series both draw inspiration from natural patterns and mathematical principles. ACO is a computational algorithm based on the foraging behavior of ants. Ants leave pheromone trails to guide others, and over time, they collectively identify optimal paths. Similarly, the Fibonacci series, defined by the recurrence relation F(n)=F(n−1)+F(n−2)F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)F(n)=F(n−1)+F(n−2), emerges in various natural phenomena and mathematical applications, such as spirals in shells or tree branching.
The connection between ACO and Fibonacci lies in their shared ability to model efficiency and optimization. Fibonacci ratios, particularly the golden ratio (ϕ≈1.618), are known for their prevalence in patterns that maximize efficiency, such as the packing of seeds in sunflowers or the spirals of galaxies. In ACO, incorporating Fibonacci principles can enhance the algorithm’s natural adaptability, making it even more efficient in finding optimal solutions to complex problems.
This presentation explores how Fibonacci numbers can influence ACO, focusing on areas like pheromone decay, exploration-exploitation balance, and hierarchical path selection. By combining the two, researchers can develop more efficient, nature-inspired solutions for optimization challenges in fields like logistics, networking, and artificial intelligence.
