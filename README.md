Mathematical implications of Fibonacci:
Topics include:
1- Number Theory
2- Combinatorics
3- Algebra
4- Graph Theory (Professor’s Favorite)
5- Exponential Growth (My favorite)
Professor love graph theory and we are currently studying counting which comes under the umbrella of combinatorics so I have to give these two topics the most weightage.

1- Number Theory :-
* Divisibility Properties:
  Every third Fibonacci number is divisible by 2
  Every fourth Fibonacci number is divisible by 3
  Every fifth Fibonacci number is divisible by 5
{
Q- How can I make this more interactive and visual to engage the audience?
Ans-
1. Visual Pattern Exploration with Color-Coding:
Preparation of a chart that shows the divisibility of the Fibonacci numbers.
2. Interactive “Mod” Activity
   Give each participant a small card with a Fibonacci number on it and have them apply modular arithmetic. 
   For example, they can divide their number by 3 and note the remainder (the “mod 3” result).
   Ask them to call out their mod results to reveal Pisano periods (the cycle lengths in mod). 
   You could demonstrate, for instance, that the sequence mod 3 will show a repeating pattern of 8 terms.
3. Digital Visualization with Calculators or an App
If a Fibonacci calculator or app is available, show how quickly it computes terms. 
You can use this to explore specific numbers that are divisible by chosen divisors
4. Real-World Connection
   To engage their curiosity, explain briefly how this modular repetition (Pisano periods) has applications,
   such as in cryptography. You could mention how cryptographic algorithms rely on these cycles for encoding
   information securely, adding a real-world relevance to the concept,
}
* Pisano periods :-

A Pisano period, denoted as ?(m)\pi(m)?(m), is the length of the repeating cycle of the Fibonacci sequence taken modulo m. In other words, 
if you calculate the Fibonacci numbers and reduce them modulo m,
 the sequence of remainders will eventually start to repeat. The length of this cycle is the Pisano period for m.

*  Computational Efficiency: Pisano periods allow for efficient calculations of Fibonacci numbers in modular arithmetic. Instead of calculating large Fibonacci numbers directly, one can compute the remainder when divided by mmm using the period.
*  Number Theory: They reveal deep relationships between Fibonacci numbers and modular arithmetic. For example, properties like the GCD (greatest common divisor) can often be explored through Pisano periods.
*  Applications in Cryptography: Some cryptographic algorithms may use Fibonacci sequences, and understanding Pisano periods can enhance the efficiency and security of these systems.
*  Patterns in Nature: The occurrence of Pisano periods can also relate to patterns seen in nature and mathematical structures, showing the interconnectedness of different fields.

Introduction to the Fibonacci Sequence
What Fibonacci sequence is?

Definition:-
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number (known as a Fibonacci number) is the sum of the two preceding ones. It typically starts with 0 and 1 or 0 and 0.
 The sequence goes:
0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,…

Significance:-
The Fibonacci sequence not only holds mathematical significance but also reveals profound connections within nature and practical applications in fields like finance. Its beauty lies in its simplicity and its ability to describe complex patterns found throughout our world. Whether you're studying mathematics or observing nature's design, the Fibonacci sequence offers endless fascination and insight. The Fibonacci sequence is not just a mathematical curiosity; it represents fundamental principles that govern growth patterns in nature and art. Its connections with various fields—from biology to finance—demonstrate its universal relevance. By understanding the properties and applications of this remarkable sequence, we gain insight into both mathematical theory and real-world phenomena. As we continue exploring mathematics and its applications, let us appreciate how concepts like the Fibonacci sequence enrich our understanding of the world around us. Whether through its aesthetic beauty or practical utility, the Fibonacci sequence remains a captivating subject worthy of study and admiration.

Recursive Nature:-
The recursive formula defining the Fibonacci sequence means that each term relies on its predecessors. This property makes it an excellent example of recursion in mathematics.

Formula:-
Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2,
Fn-1 = the previous term;
Fn-2 = the term before that;

Example:-
5 = 3 + 2;
The most important phenomenon of the Fibonacci sequence:-
The Golden Ratio - The Divine Proportion
How the ratio of successive Fibonacci numbers approximates the golden ratio? = 1.61803. As the sequence progresses, the ratio between consecutive Fibonacci numbers gets closer to this golden ratio. The ratio as we divide two consecutive terms of the Fibonacci sequence is the most beautiful and important part of this sequence. The human body itself exhibits Fibonacci proportions. The ratio of the length of the forearm to the length of the hand, for example, is often close to the Golden Ratio.
Many composers have used the sequence to structure their compositions and create harmonious melodies.

Historical Background
The sequence was introduced to the Western world by Leonardo of Pisa, known as Fibonacci, in his 1202 book "Liber Abaci" (The Book of Calculation). Fibonacci used the sequence to illustrate the growth pattern of a population of rabbits, starting from a single pair, assuming that every month each pair of mature rabbits produces a new pair, which becomes productive from the second month on.
The Book of Calculations by Liber Abaci explains the power of the Fibonacci sequence. How it emerges in the world.
Fibonacci sequence First discovery
Fibonacci was not discovered by Liber Abaci but in ancient India 1000s of years ago. The Sanskrit grammarian Pingala mentioned a sequence resembling Fibonacci's in texts dating back to between the 5th century BC and the 3rd century AD.
Liber Abaci’s contribution was that he introduced it to the Western world and showed growth patterns through it.
The literal meaning of Fibonacci:-
The literal meaning of Fibonacci is ‘son of the Bonacci clan’.
Multiples in Fibonacci number
* Every 3rd Fibonacci number is a multiple of 2.
* Every 4th Fibonacci number is a multiple of 3.
* Every 5th Fibonacci number is a multiple of 5.
* Every 6th Fibonacci number is a multiple of 8.
* And so on.

What was the Fibonacci New Year?
The Fibonacci new year was 1/1/23.
Do you know how many kilo-meters are in a mile?
There are 1.6 miles in 1 km. 1.6 is the value of the Golden ratio.
If you want to know how many miles in a km you can just see the Fibonacci sequence.
8 miles = 13km,
And 90 km round down to 89km = 55 miles.
Introduction to Spiral
Spiral is the concept of the Fibonacci number. The number of petals in a flower, and leaves are all according to the Fibonacci sequence. Spiral on a pine cone or the head of a sunflower is often a Fibonacci sequence.
Fibonacci in Trading: A Powerful Tool for Technical Analysis
The Fibonacci sequence is used in trading to predict price levels. Fibonacci is a tool which used in two main studies:-
Retracement and Extension:-
The retracement predicts where the price will pull back (to entry levels), and the extension predicts the level that the price will push beyond the initial trend (exit levels).
Key Fibonacci Ratios:
* 23.6%: A minor retracement level
* 38.2%: A significant retracement level
* 50%: A psychological level often used in trading
* 61.8%: A major retracement level, also known as the Golden Ratio   
* 78.6%: A strong retracement level
Downtrends
It starts from swing high to swing low.
Uptrends
It starts from swing low to swing high.
Introduction to Torus Field:-
A torus field refers to a geometric structure resembling a doughnut shape (torus) that can be used to describe various physical phenomena. In mathematics and physics, toroidal structures are often used to model systems with circular symmetry or periodic boundary conditions.
Relationship between Fibonacci Sequence and Torus Field:-
* The Fibonacci sequence is closely related to the Golden Ratio (approximately 1.618), which appears in various geometrical constructions, including those involving toroidal shapes. The ratio of successive Fibonacci numbers converges to the Golden Ratio as n increases.
* When visualizing the Fibonacci sequence through spirals (often seen in nature), these spirals can be mapped onto a toroidal surface. This connection illustrates how mathematical sequences can manifest in three-dimensional shapes.
Computational Models:-
In computational mathematics and simulations involving toroidal geometries (like simulations of fluid dynamics or wave propagation), Fibonacci numbers can be used to establish grid points or sampling methods that reflect natural growth patterns.
Connection with Other Mathematical Concepts:-
The Fibonacci sequence relates closely to other mathematical constructs:
* Lucas Numbers: Another integer sequence defined similarly but starting with different initial values.

The Great Pyramid of Giza:
* Some theories suggest that the dimensions of the Great Pyramid incorporate the Golden Ratio.
* The ratio of the height to half the base length is close to the Golden Ratio.
Fibonacci in Cryptography - Secret Code of Numbers
* Encrypting with Fibonacci: Fibonacci sequences create complex keys for encryption, helping secure digital communications.
* Explain how patterns that grow non-linearly (like Fibonacci) make it hard to crack codes, a reason why it’s popular in cryptography.
Fibonacci in Sports:-
From golf to martial arts, body movements and timing can align with Fibonacci sequences, helping optimize performance and reduce fatigue.

Fibonacci – A basis for e^x:-
Fibonacci number can also give the basis for a function whose derivative is also itself.
