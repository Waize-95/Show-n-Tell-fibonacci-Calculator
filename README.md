Mathematical implications of Fibonacci:
Topics include:
1- Number Theory
2- Combinatorics
3- Algebra
4- Graph Theory (Professor’s Favorite)
5- Exponential Growth (My favorite)
Professor love graph theory and we are currently studying counting which comes under the umbrella of combinatorics so I have to give these two topics the most weightage.

1- Number Theory :-
* Divisibility Properties:
  Every third Fibonacci number is divisible by 2
  Every fourth Fibonacci number is divisible by 3
  Every fifth Fibonacci number is divisible by 5
{
Q- How can I make this more interactive and visual to engage the audience?
Ans-
1. Visual Pattern Exploration with Color-Coding:
Preparation of a chart that shows the divisibility of the Fibonacci numbers.
2. Interactive “Mod” Activity
   Give each participant a small card with a Fibonacci number on it and have them apply modular arithmetic. 
   For example, they can divide their number by 3 and note the remainder (the “mod 3” result).
   Ask them to call out their mod results to reveal Pisano periods (the cycle lengths in mod). 
   You could demonstrate, for instance, that the sequence mod 3 will show a repeating pattern of 8 terms.
3. Digital Visualization with Calculators or an App
If a Fibonacci calculator or app is available, show how quickly it computes terms. 
You can use this to explore specific numbers that are divisible by chosen divisors
4. Real-World Connection
   To engage their curiosity, explain briefly how this modular repetition (Pisano periods) has applications,
   such as in cryptography. You could mention how cryptographic algorithms rely on these cycles for encoding
   information securely, adding a real-world relevance to the concept,
}
* Pisano periods :-

A Pisano period, denoted as ?(m)\pi(m)?(m), is the length of the repeating cycle of the Fibonacci sequence taken modulo m. In other words, 
if you calculate the Fibonacci numbers and reduce them modulo m,
 the sequence of remainders will eventually start to repeat. The length of this cycle is the Pisano period for m.

*  Computational Efficiency: Pisano periods allow for efficient calculations of Fibonacci numbers in modular arithmetic. Instead of calculating large Fibonacci numbers directly, one can compute the remainder when divided by mmm using the period.
*  Number Theory: They reveal deep relationships between Fibonacci numbers and modular arithmetic. For example, properties like the GCD (greatest common divisor) can often be explored through Pisano periods.
*  Applications in Cryptography: Some cryptographic algorithms may use Fibonacci sequences, and understanding Pisano periods can enhance the efficiency and security of these systems.
*  Patterns in Nature: The occurrence of Pisano periods can also relate to patterns seen in nature and mathematical structures, showing the interconnectedness of different fields.

Introduction to the Fibonacci Sequence
What Fibonacci sequence is?
Definition:-
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number (known as a Fibonacci number) is the sum of the two preceding ones. It typically starts with 0 and 1 or 0 and 0.
 The sequence goes:
0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,…
Formula:-
Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2,
Fn-1 = the previous term;
Fn-2 = the term before that;
Example:-
5 = 3 +2;
The most important phenomenon of Fibonacci sequence:-
The ratio of successive Fibonacci numbers approximates the golden ratio ? = 1.61803. As the sequence progresses, the ratio between consecutive Fibonacci numbers gets closer to this golden ratio. The ratio as we divide two consecutive terms of Fibonacci sequence is the most beautiful and important part of this sequence.
Historical Background
The sequence was introduced to the Western world by Leonardo of Pisa, known as Fibonacci, in his 1202 book "Liber Abaci" (The Book of Calculation). Fibonacci used the sequence to illustrate the growth pattern of a population of rabbits, starting from a single pair, assuming that every month each pair of mature rabbits produces a new pair, which becomes productive from the second month on.
The Book of Calculation by Liber Abaci explain the power of Fibonacci sequence. How it emerges in the world.
Fibonacci sequence First discovery
Fibonacci was not discovered by Liber Abaci but it was discovered in ancient India 1000 of years of ago.
Liber Abaci contribution was that he introduced it to the western world and showed growed patterns through it.
Literal meaning of Fibonacci:-
The literal meaning if Fibonacci is ‘Son of Banacci’.
Multiples in Fibonacci number
* Every 3rd Fibonacci number is a multiple of 2.
* Every 4th Fibonacci number is a multiple of 3.
* Every 5th Fibonacci number is a multiple of 5.
* Every 6th Fibonacci number is a multiple of 8.
* And so on.

What was the Fibonacci new year?
The Fibonacci new year was 1/1/23.
Do you know how many kilo-meters in a mile?
There are 1.6 miles in 1 km. 1.6 is the value of Golden ratio.
If you want to know how many miles in a km you can just see the Fibonacci sequence.
8 miles = 13km,
And 90 km round down to 89km = 55 miles.
Introduction to Spiral
Spiral is concept of Fibonacci number. The number of petals in a flower, the number of leaves are all according to Fibonacci sequence. Spiral on a pine cone or the head of a sunflower is often a Fibonacci sequence.
Fibonacci in Trading: A Powerful Tool for Technical Analysis
Fibonacci sequence is used in trading to predict price levels. Fibonacci is a tool which used in two main studies:-
Retracement and Extension:-
The retracement predicts where price will pullback (to entry levels), and extension predicts the level that the price will push to beyond the initial trend (exit levels).
Key Fibonacci Ratios:
* 23.6%: A minor retracement level
* 38.2%: A significant retracement level
* 50%: A psychological level often used in trading
* 61.8%: A major retracement level, also known as the Golden Ratio   
* 78.6%: A strong retracement level
Downtrends
It starts from swing high to swing low.
Uptrends
It starts from swing low to swing high.
