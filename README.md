Created the "Show-n-Tell-Fibonacci-Calculator" repository and deciding topic with group remembers as well as deciding the topic with Nofal
Deciding on the presentation topic and discussing it with Nofal (Sarfraz's student). Planning the project and preparing for show and tell.

Mathematical implications of Fibonacci:
Topics include:
1- Number Theory
2- Combinatorics
3- Algebra
4- Graph Theory (Professor’s Favorite)
5- Exponential Growth (My favorite)
Professor love graph theory and we are currently studying counting which comes under the umbrella of combinatorics so I have to give these two topics the most weightage.

1- Number Theory :-
* Divisibility Properties:
  Every third Fibonacci number is divisible by 2
  Every fourth Fibonacci number is divisible by 3
  Every fifth Fibonacci number is divisible by 5

Q- How can I make this more interactive and visual to engage the audience?
Ans-
1. Visual Pattern Exploration with Color-Coding:
Preparation of a chart that shows the divisibility of the Fibonacci numbers.
2. Interactive “Mod” Activity
   Give each participant a small card with a Fibonacci number on it and have them apply modular arithmetic. 
   For example, they can divide their number by 3 and note the remainder (the “mod 3” result).
   Ask them to call out their mod results to reveal Pisano periods (the cycle lengths in mod). 
   You could demonstrate, for instance, that the sequence mod 3 will show a repeating pattern of 8 terms.
3. Digital Visualization with Calculators or an App
If a Fibonacci calculator or app is available, show how quickly it computes terms. 
You can use this to explore specific numbers that are divisible by chosen divisors
4. Real-World Connection
   To engage their curiosity, explain briefly how this modular repetition (Pisano periods) has applications,
   such as in cryptography. You could mention how cryptographic algorithms rely on these cycles for encoding
   information securely, adding a real-world relevance to the concept,

* Pisano periods :-

A Pisano period, denoted as ?(m)\pi(m)?(m), is the length of the repeating cycle of the Fibonacci sequence taken modulo m. In other words, 
if you calculate the Fibonacci numbers and reduce them modulo m,
 the sequence of remainders will eventually start to repeat. The length of this cycle is the Pisano period for m.

*  Computational Efficiency: Pisano periods allow for efficient calculations of Fibonacci numbers in modular arithmetic. Instead of calculating large Fibonacci numbers directly, one can compute the remainder when divided by mmm using the period.
*  Number Theory: They reveal deep relationships between Fibonacci numbers and modular arithmetic. For example, properties like the GCD (greatest common divisor) can often be explored through Pisano periods.
*  Applications in Cryptography: Some cryptographic algorithms may use Fibonacci sequences, and understanding Pisano periods can enhance the efficiency and security of these systems.
*  Patterns in Nature: The occurrence of Pisano periods can also relate to patterns seen in nature and mathematical structures, showing the interconnectedness of different fields.
