Key Steps in ACO:
1.	Initialization: Ants are randomly placed on nodes (e.g., cities in TSP).
2.	Path Selection: Each ant selects paths probabilistically based on pheromone intensity and a heuristic factor like distance.
3.	Pheromone Update: Successful paths are reinforced with more pheromones, while others evaporate.
4.	Iteration: Over multiple cycles, the system converges on the optimal path.
ACO excels in dynamic environments, adapting as conditions change. For example, in network routing, ants can find alternate paths when links fail.
Fibonacci principles can enhance ACO by introducing natural growth and decay patterns in pheromone updates. For example, pheromones could decay following Fibonacci ratios, ensuring a balance between exploration and exploitation. Similarly, Fibonacci's recursive structure aligns with ACO's iterative nature, making it an ideal complement for guiding decision-making in complex systems.
