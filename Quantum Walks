Quantum walk is a key operation in quantum computing, simulation, communication and information. 
Here, we report for the first time the demonstration of quantum walks and localized quantum walks in a new type of optical fibers having 
a ring of cores constructed with both periodic and quasiperiodic Fibonacci sequences, respectively. Good agreement between theoretical and experimental 
results has been achieved. The new multicore ring fibers provide a new platform for experiments of quantum effects in low-loss optical fibers
which is critical for scalability of real applications with large-size problems. Furthermore, our new quasiperiodic Fibonacci multicore ring fibers provide 
a new class of quasiperiodic photonics lattices possessing both on- and off-diagonal deterministic disorders for realizing localized quantum walks deterministically. 
The proposed Fibonacci fibers are simple and straightforward to fabricate and have a rich set of properties that are of potential use for quantum applications.
Our simulation and experimental results show that, in contrast with randomly disordered structures, localized quantum walks in new proposed quasiperiodic photonics 
lattices are highly controllable due to the deterministic disordered nature of quasiperiodic systems.
