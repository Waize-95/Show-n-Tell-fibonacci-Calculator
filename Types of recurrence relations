In Fibonacci the recurrence relation is:
              F(n)=F(n-1) + F(n-2)
With base cases,
                  F(0)=0 , F(1)=1
This type of recurrence relation is Linear and homogeneous. Which means:
Linear: Term is a combination of preceding terms. 
Homogeneous: The Sequence depends only on previous terms

Some other types of Recurrence Relations are :
Non-Linear: A relation where the terms are combinations in a non-linear way i.e., through multiplications or exponents.
Example: Factorial Sequence :
F(n) = n. F(n-1), F(0) =1.
Non-Homogeneous : A Sequence that not only depends on the previous terms but also has any additional independent terms.
Example: Arithmetic Sequence with a Linear term
an = 2an-1 +n , a(0)=1
This recurrence has an additional term â€˜n which makes it non-linear
