STEGANOGRAPHY
Definition
The word steganography means covered writing. It is the practice of concealing information such that the existence of apparent message is not visible to the observer.
Earliest use
Herodotus known as the father of history described a method of secret writing. He used a wooden board to write a message and covered it with wax. This technique was used to send military correspondence During Greeceâ€™s war with Persia in 5th century BC. This sort of concealment is known steganography.
Draw Backs
The main issue was that if the message was discovered its contents were revealed easily. This dilemma gave rise to cryptography.
