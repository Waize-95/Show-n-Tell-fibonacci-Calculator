•	Nature: Sunflower seed arrangements and pinecone spirals align with Fibonacci spirals, optimizing space utilization.
•	Mathematics: Fibonacci is used in algorithms like the Fibonacci search, a divide-and-conquer approach for finding extrema.
•	Data Structures: Fibonacci heaps, a type of priority queue, reduce complexity in graph algorithms.
The series inherently balances growth and decay, offering a framework for efficient resource allocation and iterative problem-solving. This balance makes Fibonacci an excellent candidate for enhancing algorithms like ACO. The golden ratio’s self-similar property can help guide decision-making in optimization problems, aligning with ACO’s iterative path refinement process.
By applying Fibonacci principles, ACO can inherit the series' natural efficiency, improving its capacity to model and solve real-world challenges.
