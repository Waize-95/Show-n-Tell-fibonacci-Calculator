# Fibonacci Tree Node Count


The number of nodes in a Fibonacci tree F(n)  can be represented as follows:

- A Fibonacci tree is a binary tree structure where  F(0) has 1 node, and  F(1)  has 1 node.
- For \( n \geq 2 \), the Fibonacci tree \( F(n) \) is constructed recursively as:
  [
  F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) + 1
  ]
  where the "+1" accounts for the root node.
  Total Number of Nodes

The number of nodes \( N(n) \) in \( F(n) \) can be expressed in terms of the Fibonacci sequence. Specifically, the total number of nodes in a Fibonacci tree \( F(n) \) is given by:
[ N(n) = F(n+2) - 1]
where ( F(n+2) ) is the \((n+2)\)th Fibonacci number.

This relationship comes from the way the Fibonacci tree is built, as each \( F(n) \) is composed of subtrees that align with Fibonacci numbers.
