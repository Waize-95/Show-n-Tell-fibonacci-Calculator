3 Fibonacci Sequence in Magnetic Resonance
Recent studies have shown that the Fibonacci sequence can influence magnetic
resonance in certain materials. In these studies, scientists created artificial struc-
tures where the atomic spacing followed the Fibonacci sequence. They observed
that this unique arrangement could control the magnetic and electrical proper-
ties of the material in unexpected ways.
