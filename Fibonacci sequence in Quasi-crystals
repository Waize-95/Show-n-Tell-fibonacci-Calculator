1 Introduction to the Fibonacci Sequence
What Fibonacci sequence is?
1.1 Definition:-
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number (known as
a Fibonacci number) is the sum of the two preceding ones. It typically starts
with 0 and 1 or 0 and 0. The sequence goes: 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,...
1.2 Formula:-
Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2; Fn-1 = the previous term; Fn-2 = the term before that;
Example:- 5 = 3 + 2
1.3 Recursive Nature:-
The recursive formula defining the Fibonacci sequence means that each term re-
lies on its predecessors. This property makes it an excellent example of recursion
in mathematics.
1.4 Historical Background
The sequence was introduced to the Western world by Leonardo of Pisa, known
as Fibonacci, in his 1202 book ”Liber Abaci” (The Book of Calculation). Fi-
bonacci used the sequence to illustrate the growth pattern of a population of
rabbits, starting from a single pair, assuming that every month each pair of
mature rabbits produces a new pair, which becomes productive from the second
month on. The Book of Calculations by Liber Abaci explains the power of the
Fibonacci sequence. How it emerges in the world.
1.5 Fibonacci sequence First discovery
Fibonacci was not discovered by Liber Abaci but in ancient India 1000s of
years ago. The Sanskrit grammarian ’Pingala’ mentioned a sequence resembling
1
Fibonacci’s in texts dating back to the 5th century BC and the 3rd century AD.
Liber Abaci’s contribution was that he introduced it to the Western world and
showed growth patterns through it.
If you want to know how many miles in a km you can just see the Fibonacci
sequence. 8 miles = 13km, And 90 km round down to 89km = 55 miles.
2 Fibonacci Numbers in Quantum Mechanics
2.1 Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Computing
Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that describes the be-
havior of particles at the smallest scales, such as atoms and subatomic particles.
It fundamentally differs from classical physics in several ways, focusing on the
probabilistic nature of phenomena rather than deterministic laws.
Quantum computing is an area of computing that leverages the principles of
quantum mechanics to process information in fundamentally different ways than
classical computers. Unlike classical computers, which use bits as the smallest
unit of data (represented as 0s or 1s), quantum computers use quantum bits or
qubits.
Recent research has shown that Fibonacci numbers can appear in the behavior
of quantum particles. Specifically, the sequence has been observed in the energy
levels of certain quantum systems. This is a groundbreaking area of study that
combines the elegance of mathematical sequences with the mysterious world of
quantum physics.
2.2 Connection with Mathematics and Nature
This connection is amazing because it bridges the gap between abstract math-
ematics and the fundamental nature of reality. It suggests that the Fibonacci
sequence, which we often associate with natural patterns and growth, also plays
a role in the behavior of particles at the smallest scales. This insight could lead
to new ways of understanding quantum systems and potentially new technolo-
gies based on quantum mechanics.
2.3 Knowledge about It
Most people are unaware of this connection because it’s a relatively new area of
research. The idea that a simple mathematical sequence could have implications
for quantum mechanics is both surprising and exciting. It opens up a whole new
realm of possibilities for interdisciplinary studies and applications.
2.3.1 Why It’s Rarely Known
Quantum mechanics is already a complex and specialized field, and the appear-
ance of Fibonacci numbers adds another layer of complexity. This intersection

of mathematics and physics is not widely covered in mainstream education or
media, making it a hidden gem for those interested in both areas.
2.4 Recent Research
Recent studies have shown that Fibonacci numbers can play a role in the be-
havior of quantum particles. Physicists have conducted experiments where they
used laser pulses following the Fibonacci sequence to interact with quantum
systems. The results were astonishing: the quantum states of particles lasted
significantly longer than expected.
2.5 New Phase of Matter
In one experiment, physicists shot laser pulses mimicking the Fibonacci sequence
at a quantum computer. This created a new phase of matter that is particularly
robust in preserving quantum information. This phase is more stable than cur-
rent methods used in quantum computing, which is a significant breakthrough.
Let me break this down into simpler parts:
1. First, the problem they’re trying to solve: - Quantum computers are very
fragile - They easily lose their quantum information (like a delicate house of
cards falling down) - Scientists need ways to make quantum information last
longer
2. The Fibonacci sequence: - It’s a simple pattern: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13... -
Each number is the sum of the two before it - Think of it like a special rhythm
or pattern
3. What they did: - They used lasers to ”poke” atoms in the quantum
computer - Instead of poking randomly, they poked following the Fibonacci
pattern - Like playing a drum following a specific rhythm
4. What happened: - This created a special arrangement of atoms (a new
”phase of matter”) - Think of it like turning water (one phase) into ice (another
phase) - But this is a quantum phase, much more exotic
5. Why it’s important: - This new phase is more stable - Like building a
stronger house of cards that doesn’t fall down easily - This could help make
quantum computers more reliable
The breakthrough is similar to finding a way to make a sensitive musical
instrument that stays in tune longer instead of going out of tune quickly.
2.6 Quasicrystals and Quantum Coherence
The Fibonacci sequence acts as a quasi-periodic sequence, meaning it is ordered
but not repeating. This quasi-periodic nature helps cancel out errors that typ-
ically occur at the edges of quantum states, allowing the quantum states to
remain coherent for much longer periods. This is crucial for the development of
reliable quantum computers.

2.6.1 Discovery
In 1984, physicist Dan Shechtman discovered quasicrystals, a finding so revolu-
tionary it earned him a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2011. These quasicrystals
exhibit a form of symmetry called ”five-fold symmetry,” which is forbidden in
traditional crystallography. The discovery sparked immense interest because it
challenged the previously held beliefs about atomic structure.
