Explanation of Pseudocode:
1-	The input to the function is ‘n’ which is the desired term.
2-	Then we define the condition that if ‘n’ is equal to 0 or 1, the function immediately return ‘n’ as this is the base case.
3-	We initialize our ‘x’ variable by 0 representing F(0) and ‘y’ variable as 1 representing F(1).
4-	Then the loop starts from 1 and goes up to (n-1).{At i=1, the loop is calculating the second Fibonacci number so the loop will only go up to n-1}.
5-	At each iteration, ‘z’ is calculated as the next Fibonacci term while x and y are initialized to the next terms.
6-	After the loop ends y holds the desired value.
