ACO is particularly powerful for complex, combinatorial problems where traditional methods struggle. Key parameters like pheromone deposition, evaporation rate, and path selection influence its performance. By fine-tuning these parameters, ACO can dynamically adapt to changes, offering robust solutions.
Integrating Fibonacci principles into ACO can further improve its adaptability and convergence speed, as Fibonacci numbers naturally balance growth and decay, reflecting optimization principles observed in nature.
